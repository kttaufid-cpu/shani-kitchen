# Menu Images Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Images are now visible!

The website now uses placeholder images that will display properly. You can see gray placeholder boxes with text labels for each menu item.

## Next Steps: Add Your Real Food Photos

To replace the placeholders with your actual food photos:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images
- Take photos of your actual dishes (like the Nasi Ganja with yellow rice and fried chicken you showed)
- Recommended size: 400x300 pixels or similar 4:3 ratio
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Make sure they're clear and appetizing!

### Step 2: Add Your Images to the Images Folder
Copy your food photos to this folder with these exact names:

#### NASI ARAB TALAM Section:
- `ayam-single.jpg` - Single portion chicken with rice
- `ayam-couple.jpg` - Double portion chicken with rice  
- `daging-hitam.jpg` - Black beef curry
- `kambing-hitam.jpg` - Black mutton curry
- `sup-tulang.jpg` - Bone marrow soup with mutton
- `lamb-shank.jpg` - Lamb shank with rice
- `family-small.jpg` - Small family pack (4 portions)
- `family-big.jpg` - Big family pack (8 portions)

#### NASI GANJA Section:
- `nasi-ganja-ayam.jpg` - Nasi Ganja with spiced fried chicken
- `daging-itam.jpg` - Black beef curry
- `kambing-itam.jpg` - Black mutton curry
- `sup-tulang-kambing.jpg` - Bone marrow soup with mutton

### Step 3: Update the HTML
After adding your images, change the image sources in `index.html` from:
```
https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/f4f4f4/999?text=Name
```
to:
```
images/your-image-name.jpg
```

### Example:
Your Nasi Ganja photos would be perfect for:
- `nasi-ganja-ayam.jpg` - The yellow rice with fried chicken and sauces
- `ayam-single.jpg` - Single portion with the beautiful presentation

## Current Display
The website now shows placeholder images that look like gray boxes with text labels. This confirms the image system is working correctly!

## Tips for Great Food Photos:
- Use natural lighting if possible
- Show the complete meal including sides and garnishes
- Keep the background clean and focused on the food
- Take photos from above (45-degree angle works well)

Once you add your real photos and update the HTML paths, your Shani Kitchen website will showcase your delicious authentic dishes!
